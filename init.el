;; What is Emacs-Kick?
;;
;; Emacs-Kick is `not' a distribution.
;;
;; Emacs-Kick is a starting point for your own configuration.  The goal
;; is that you can read every line of code, top-to-bottom, understand
;; what your configuration is doing, and modify it to suit your needs.
;;
;; Once you've done that, you can start exploring, configuring, and
;; tinkering to make Emacs your own! That might mean leaving Emacs
;; Kick just the way it is for a while or immediately breaking it into
;; modular pieces.  It's up to you!
;;
;; If you don't know anything about Emacs Lisp, I recommend taking
;; some time to read through a guide.
;; One possible example which will only take 10-15 minutes:
;; - https://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/elisp/
;;
;; After understanding a bit more about Emacs Lisp, you can use `M-x
;; info RET` (info) for a reference on how Emacs integrates it.
;;
;; Emacs-Kick Guide:
;;
;; Well, this config ASSUMES you already knows (neo)vi(m) bindings,
;; and the bases of how it works.  This is the `Emacs config for
;; vimmers'.  So, if you're not familiar with it, go for
;; `kickstart.nvim', get used to it, and than come back.
;;
;; On Emacs help can be found multiple ways.
;; With this config, the leader key as SPC.
;; - <leader> h i opens the info (Also `M-x info RET')
;; - <leader> h v explores available variables
;; - <leader> h f explores avaliable functions
;; - <leader> h k explores avaliable keybindings
;;
;; If, at any time you need to find some functionality, Emacs `M-x'
;; (Meta is alt on most cases, option or command), works like a
;; command pallete, you can for example type `M-x quit' and be
;; presented with various options to quit Emacs.
;;
;; Once you've completed that, you can continue working through
;; `AND READING' the rest of the kickstart configuration.
;;
;; I have left several comments throughout the configuration.  These
;; are hints about where to find more information about the relevant
;; settings, packages, or Emacs features used in Emacs-Kick.
;;
;; Feel free to delete them once you know what you're doing, but they
;; should serve as a guide for when you are first encountering a few
;; different constructs in your Emacs config.
;;
;; If you encounter any errors while installing Emacs-Kick,
;; check the *Messages* buffer for more information. You can switch
;; buffers using `<leader> SPC`, and all option menus can be navigated
;; with `C-p` and `C-n`.
;;
;; I hope you enjoy your Emacs journey,
;; - Rahul
;;
;; P.S.  You can delete this when you're done too.  It's your config
;; now! :)


;;; Code:

;; Performance Hacks
;; Emacs is an Elisp interpreter, and when running programs or packages,
;; it can occasionally experience pauses due to garbage collection.
;; By increasing the garbage collection threshold, we reduce these pauses
;; during heavy operations, leading to smoother performance.
(setq gc-cons-threshold #x40000000)

;; Set the maximum output size for reading process output, allowing for larger data transfers.
(setq read-process-output-max (* 1024 1024 4))

;; Do I really need a speedy startup?
;; Well, this config launches Emacs in about ~0.3 seconds,
;; which, in modern terms, is a miracle considering how fast it starts
;; with external packages.
;; It wasn’t until the recent introduction of tools for lazy loading
;; that a startup time of less than 20 seconds was even possible.
;; Other fast startup methods were introduced over time.
;; You may have heard of people running Emacs as a server,
;; where you start it once and open multiple clients instantly connected to that server.
;; Some even run Emacs as a systemd or sysV service, starting when the machine boots.
;; While this is a great way of using Emacs, we WON’T be doing that here.
;; I think 0.3 seconds is fast enough to avoid issues that could arise from
;; running Emacs as a server, such as 'What version of Node is my LSP using?'.
;; Again, this setup configures Emacs much like how a Vimmer would configure Neovim.

;; Emacs already comes with its on package manager.
;; Others are available, but let's stick with the defaults when it makes sense.
;;
;; Requires the Emacs default package manager, so we can set it. Kind of an 'import'.
(require 'package)
;; Add MELPA (Milkypostman's Emacs Lisp Package Archive) to the list of package archives.
;; This allows you to install packages from this widely-used repository, similar to how
;; pip works for Python or npm for Node.js. While Emacs comes with ELPA (Emacs Lisp
;; Package Archive) configured by default, which contains packages that meet specific
;; licensing criteria, MELPA offers a broader range of packages and is considered the
;; standard for Emacs users. You can also add more package archives later as needed.
(add-to-list 'package-archives '("melpa" . "https://melpa.org/packages/") t)

;; Initialize the package system. In Emacs, a package is a collection of Elisp code
;; that extends the functionality of the editor, similar to plugins in Neovim.
;; By calling `package-initialize', we load the list of available packages from
;; the configured archives (like MELPA) and make them ready for installation and use.
;; This process is akin to using lazy.nvim or packer.nvim in Neovim, which manage
;; plugin installations and configurations. While there are third-party package managers
;; available for Emacs, such as straight.el and use-package, we are sticking with
;; the default package manager for simplicity in this configuration.
(package-initialize)


;; Define a global customizable variable `ek-use-nerd-fonts' to control the use of
;; Nerd Fonts symbols throughout the configuration. This boolean variable allows
;; users to easily enable or disable the use of symbols from Nerd Fonts, providing
;; flexibility in appearance settings. By setting it to `t', we enable Nerd Fonts
;; symbols; setting it to `nil' would disable them.
(defcustom ek-use-nerd-fonts t
  "Configuration for using Nerd Fonts Symbols."
  :type 'boolean
  :group 'appearance)


;; From now on, you'll see configurations using the `use-package' macro, which
;; allows us to organize our Emacs setup in a modular way. These configurations
;; look like this:
;;
;; (use-package some-package
;;   :ensure t  ;; Ensure the package is installed.
;;   :config    ;; Configuration settings for the package.
;;   ;; Additional settings can go here.
;; )
;;
;; This approach simplifies package management, enabling us to easily control
;; both built-in (first-party) and external (third-party) packages. While Emacs
;; is a vast and powerful editor, using `use-package' helps streamline our
;; configuration for better organization and customization. As we proceed,
;; you'll see smaller `use-package' declarations for specific packages, which
;; will help us enable the desired features and improve our workflow.

;; management seamless without needing external plugins.

;; Eldoc provides helpful inline documentation for functions and variables

;;; ==================== EXTERNAL PACKAGES ====================
;;
;; From this point onward, all configurations will be for third-party packages

;;; VERTICO
;; Vertico enhances the completion experience in Emacs by providing a
;; vertical selection interface for both buffer and minibuffer completions.
;; Unlike traditional minibuffer completion, which displays candidates
;; in a horizontal format, Vertico presents candidates in a vertical list,
;; making it easier to browse and select from multiple options.
;;
;; In buffer completion, `switch-to-buffer' allows you to select from open buffers.
;; Vertico streamlines this process by displaying the buffer list in a way that
;; improves visibility and accessibility. This is particularly useful when you
;; have many buffers open, allowing you to quickly find the one you need.
;;
;; In minibuffer completion, such as when entering commands or file paths,
;; Vertico helps by showing a dynamic list of potential completions, making
;; it easier to choose the correct one without typing out the entire string.
